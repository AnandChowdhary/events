# Guest lecture on inclusive entrepreneurship

I was invited by Anuj Kapoor who teaches a new elective, Building Inclusive Products, at one of India's top business schools, IIM Ahmedabad. I spoke to around 50 second-year students from their flagship MBA course about my journey building products inclusively at Oswald Labs and Pabio.
