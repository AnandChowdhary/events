# Guest lecture on opportunity recognition

I was invited by Dr. Rainer Harms, Associate Professor, the Netherlands Institute for Knowledge-intensive Entrepreneurship (NIKOS), University of Twente to deliver a guest lecture on opportunity recognition.

I have been speaking on this topic at the UT for three years as a guest lecturer.
