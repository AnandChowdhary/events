# Tech Charcha by Facebook DevC

I was part of a panel discussion on the future of technology by Facebook's Developer Circles Delhi-NCR along with Chinmaya Saxena, Developer Programs Lead, Facebook India; Saransh Kataria, Chapter Lead, Facebook Developer Circle Delhi; and Shubhamoy Chakrabarty, COO at Cloudtub, Inc.

We talked about upcoming technologies such as VR and AI, and interesting areas for investment such as education and inclusion.

This is what Facebook Developer Circles Delhi-NCR said:

> Since the tech space changes every second, it is very important for one to bet on the right set of things else they might lose the momentum of growth. With this idea in mind, we are hosting Tech Charcha, an open discussion to get enlightened on emerging technologies for which a bunch of experts from industry shall be joining us. The discussions would include the latest trends in the developer ecosystem, why they emerged and also about how you can leverage these in your startup.
