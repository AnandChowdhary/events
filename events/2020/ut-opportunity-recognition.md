# Guest Lecture on Opportunity Recognition

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was at home in New Delhi, India, and was invited by Dr. Rainer Harms, Associate Professor, the Netherlands Institute for Knowledge-intensive Entrepreneurship (NIKOS), University of Twente, to deliver a guest lecture on Opportunity Recognition. Since classes were remotely held over video conference, I delivered a 30-minute lecture and answers several questions about discovering new business opportunities.

This talk was part of a series of lectures by industry professionals for the course "International Entrepreneurship — A Strategic Technology Perspective", part of the study program Business Administration MSc. International Entrepreneurship ([201600011](https://osiris.utwente.nl/student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&cursus=201600011&collegejaar=2020&taal=en)) is a 5-EC course offered to the tracks "Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Strategy" and "International Management and Consultancy" in the master's program.

I modified my usual talk to focus on my understand of opportunity recognition, with three key parts: (i) problems and tools, (ii) S³ (seek, screen, seize), and (iii) identifying opportunities by observing changes in consumer behaviors and the market.
