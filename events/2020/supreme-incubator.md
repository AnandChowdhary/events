# Mentoring for Supreme Incubator

Supreme Incubator is a 6-month startup incubator consisting of a "comprehensive curriculum, along with meetings with dedicated mentors, investor lunches, and more". In August 2020, I was invited to mentor teams and judge startups based on their pitch for the program's virtual B-Plan Event. From 350+ registrations, 102 participants were selected to form 40 teams and work on their startup ideas. The teams participated in a "bidding war" where they selected three words to develop a business idea around, and then developed pitches for the same.

In the first week, my role was limited to judging startups' pitches. Over the course of the next few weeks, I'll mentor selected startup ideas and help them build a viable business.
