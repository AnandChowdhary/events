# Guest Lecture for Global Entrepreneurship Week

In September 2020, I was invited by was invited by Dr. Rainer Harms, Associate Professor, the Netherlands Institute for Knowledge-intensive Entrepreneurship (NIKOS), University of Twente, to deliver a guest lecture on Opportunity Recognition to students of Business Administration MSc. I modified my usual talk to focus on my understand of opportunity recognition, with three key parts: (i) problems and tools, (ii) SÂ³ (seek, screen, seize), and (iii) identifying opportunities by observing changes in consumer behaviors and the market.

In the third week of November, the [Global Entrepreneurship Week](https://www.genglobal.org/gew) is celebrated, and the University of Twente invited me to deliver another guest lecture on Opportunity Recognition, this time to ~150 Business Administration BSc students.
