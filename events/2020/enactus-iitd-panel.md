# Changemaker Workshop at Enactus, IIT Delhi

I was invited by Enactus, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, to be part of a panel discussion about "How failures are not [the] opposite of success, but a part of it". This talk was part of their CHANGEMAKER workshop to help students understand the importance of learning from failures. With me on the panel was Tarusha Mittal, Chief Operations Officer of OroPocket, a fintech company.
