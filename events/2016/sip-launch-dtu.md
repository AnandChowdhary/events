# SIP Launch (DTU)

I was the keynote speaker at the launch of the Startup Internship Portal of Delhi Technological University (DTU), where I did the first public revealing of Oswald Labs' R&D blind-friendly smartphone OS, Shravan and talked about the opportunity of working with startups.

The event was organized by the Entrepreneurship Cell of DTU to bridge the gap between the industry and students.
