# Open source from scratch for CodeChef-VIT

Vellore Institute of Technology's CodeChef-VIT invited me for an interview and Q&A session during their Hacktoberfest Meetup 2021. I spoke about getting started with open source, my first contributions, and how easy it is to get started.

The video is available on CodeChef-VIT's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qLFXv6sVu4&t=1552s
