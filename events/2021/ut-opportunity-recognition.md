# Guest lecture at University of Twente

I was invited by Dr. Rainer Harms, Associate Professor, the Netherlands Institute for Knowledge-intensive Entrepreneurship (NIKOS), University of Twente to deliver a guest lecture on opportunity recognition.

I have previously spoken on this topic twice at the UT, although I was (much) better prepared this time.
