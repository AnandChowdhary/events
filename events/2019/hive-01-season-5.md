# Dragon's Den at Hive 01 Season 5

In June 2019, Hive 01 Enschede (formerly NESST Twente) organized the Dragon's Den pitching event for startups. I was one of the five Dragons and we awarded three prizes. Previously in the season, I was also a mentor for startups and keynote speaker during the opening night.
