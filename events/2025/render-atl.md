# Build your own Cursor at RenderATL

In this live coding tutorial, you'll learn how to build your own AI engineer capable of autonomously handling GitHub issues and generating pull requests with the code. This session will guide you through integrating OpenAI's Responses API with GitHub's API, enabling you to automate tasks like coding, debugging, and code reviews, essentially creating a personalized AI engineering assistant. Whether you're familiar with services like Devin, Cursor, Windsurf, or Copilot, you'll end up building a similar solution yourself in this talk.

More information will be added here soon.
