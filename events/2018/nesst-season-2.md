# Season 2 opening keynote for Nesst

In January 2018, I was featured by Het Financieele Dagblad (Dutch Financial Times) in their annual list of the Netherlands' 50 most-innovative young entrepreneurs and professionals. Shortly after, I was invited by the Enschede-based non-profit startup accelerator, Nesst (New Entrepreneurial Student Society Twente), to deliver the opening keynote for their upcoming season.

My introduction, in Dutch, was:

> Het nieuwe seizoen van Stichting Nesst begint op 7 maart en jij bent uitgenodigd! Anand Chowdhary, bekend van zijn plek in de top 50 van jonge ondernemers in Nederland, komt zijn wijsheid delen en de eerste stap in fase 1 'ideation' wordt gezet, we helpen jou van idee naar BV. Zin om erbij te zijn? De toegang is gratis en we kijken eruit je daar te zien.

Loosely translated, this means:

> The new season of Nesst starts on March 7, and you are invited! Anand Chowdhary, known for his position in the top 50 young entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, comes to share his wisdom with the first step in Phase 1, "Ideation", where we help you from idea to company. Want to be there? Entry is free, and we look forward to seeing you there.

My talk at Nesst was built on top of my usual keynote address (consisting of pitch decks and my personal story), with contextual additions for the Twente startup ecosystem. Apart from the opening keynote, I also helped mentor several startups part of the season as a pitch trainer, advisor, and jury member. I also worked with a few entrepreneurs closely, helping them primarily with scaling their technology and further developing their business.
