# HackIIITD

As our first-ever sponsored event, I was a speaker, mentor, and judge at IIIT Delhi's flagship hackathon, HackIIITD. Oswald Labs sponsored the winning prize (a spot in our accelerator program) along with a cash prize. We saw some exciting ideas â€” everything from 2FA and key management for blockchain to autonomous drones for military applications to meme video generators.

HackIIITD was a free 24-hour hackathon part of Esya 2018, the annual technology festival of IIIT Delhi.
