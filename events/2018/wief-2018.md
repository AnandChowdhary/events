# AKEPT-WIEF Social Enterprise Forum

I spoke about social entrepreneurship at the AKEPT-WIEF Social Enterprise Forum in Kuala Lumpur in October 2018. The event was a collaboration between the higher education and leadership academy AKEPT and the World Islamic Economic Forum Foundation.

As a panelist on the Plenary Session 5 on "Social Enterprise in Universities", I shared the stage with Talib S. Karim, President, Institute of Business Management (Pakistan); Sharon Feng, Overseas Director of Codemao (China); and Royston Braganza, CEO of Grameen Capital (India).

The event was held on October 22-23, 2018, at the International Islamic University Malaysia. [Learn more about the event](https://wief.org/wet_event/akept-wief-social-enterprise-forum/) or [view it on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/akept-wief-social-enterprise-forum-tickets-43152504302).
