# Speakup

In September 2018, Speakup, an Enschede-based VoIP and cloud telephony company, celebrated its 15th birthday. At the Speakup Partner & Jubileum Event, I was one of the presenters to showcase their upcoming projects into spaces like AI and mobile.

I gave a demo of Ara, an AI-powered assistant for work, which raised its seed round from Speakup.
