# Season 3 opening keynote for Nesst

New Entrepreneurial Student Society Twente (NESST) is a not-for-profit early-stage startup accelerator in Enschede. After being a speaker, advisor, and Dragons' Den judge at their third season, I was invited as the keynote speaker for the first day of Season 3.
