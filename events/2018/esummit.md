# IITK eSummit

At IIT Kanpur's flagship entrepreneurship event, eSummit 2018, I was invited to speak about my journey, lessons, and upcoming opportunities in technology. I was part of the Forbes 30 Under 30 session which featured entrepreneurs from this year's list sharing their experiences before a Q&A session.

eSummit was organized by the entrepreneurship cell of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I was joined by Nipun Goyal, co-founder of Curofy, and Abhinav Pathak co-founder and CEO of Perpule.
