# Women Who Code Cloud 2019

In September 2019, I spoke on web accessibility at Women Who Cloud 2019, the world’s ﬁrst developer conference focused on the latest in and the future of cloud-based technologies. My talk was a 35-minute tutorial on building more accessible websites and webapps, with code samples and research studies.

The talk was titled “Making your product accessible to everyone” and discussed three key parts — web standards (such as the WCAG, including semantics, color contrast, etc.), user customization (like dark theme and reduced motion), and cloud & APIs (like generating alt text for user-generated content).

It also included a short quiz about `aria-label` and demos for accessibility audits using Lighthouse and understanding the Accessibility Tree in Chrome.

The slides are available on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/anandchowdhary/making-your-products-accessible-to-everyone).
